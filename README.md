Automatic Bird Classifier - Uploader

A script to upload an image to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

This is a sub-project in my Automatic Bird Classifier. A PiCamera will has been configured to detect motion
and automatically take a picture. The Python module will then call this project to upload the image.
