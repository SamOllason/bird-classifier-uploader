# Automatic Bird Classifier - Uploader

A script to upload an image to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

This is a component in my Automatic Bird Classifier project.

I have set up Raspberry picamera to detect motion
and automatically take a picture.

A Python module then call this project to upload the image to my bucket.
